            A beautiful pre-Christmas celebration shared among friends, where
            the warmth of their connection shines as brightly as the candles
            they hold. In this simple yet meaningful gathering, each flame
            represents joy, hope, and the spirit of togetherness that the
            holiday season brings. Surrounded by laughter and smiles, they
            capture a moment of unity, creating memories that will light their
            hearts long after the candles have burned out. This evening is not
            just a countdown to Christmas but a celebration of friendship, love,
            and the promise of brighter days ahead.

            Friends from different states across Northeast India come together
            for a Discipleship Training Camp in Guwahati. Amidst the lush green
            surroundings, they share laughter, form new bonds, and grow together
            in faith. Each person brings a unique background, language, and
            culture, but they're united by a common purpose—to learn, support
            one another, and deepen their discipleship journey. This gathering
            not only strengthens their connection with God but also fosters
            lifelong friendships that bridge the diversity of Northeast India

            I never force anyone to choose me, if she thinks she can find
            something better elsewhere then i let her go ahead, I never hold
            anyone back. Life's too short to hang on to someone who's Not sure
            they wanna stay, I believe in Freedom and the truth of feelings, if
            she wanna stay i let it be because her heart tells that this is
            where she belongs, Not because i asked her to, I wanna be choice not
            a default option, I deserve someone who sees my value who understand
            what i bring to their life, I don't one someone who stay's with me
            out of fear of loneliness or out of habit. I want someone who stays
            because they can't imagine life without me. The door is always open
            she free to leave at any time so if she think her happiness lies
            elsewhere i won't stand in her way and in the meantime I'll keep
            going, I'll continue to build my own life to be happy on my own
            because my happiness doesn't depend on her presence but my own
            ability to blossom follow for consistent, improvement every day.
